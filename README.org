** Build and usage
In order to properly execute this docker-compose environment you have to build first *webdriverio*: ~docker build -t webdriverio .~ on its directory.
This compose YAML is very similar to the one given in [[https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem]], so check its README if you have any problem with
all matters concerning the ecosystem, but the following differences are present:
 - First of all, the docker network is defined as ~idm_network~, so be sure your other docker images are not using that subnet.
 - In order to select the web browser you need to comment the one you are not using (both in the image specs and in the hub links) and discomment the one you want to
   use in the hub links.
 - In this YAML we also add the new IdM, with its own SQL database, so _ensure all the users in the test cases are created before running wdio_.

To run wdio simply execute ~docker-compose run webdriverio wdio~.
